# springboot-3-security-oauth2
This repository contains multiple OAuth2-based projects, demonstrating various advanced concepts and implementations using Spring Security. The projects include an OAuth2 Authorization Server, Resource Server, and OAuth2 Client, showcasing a complete authentication flow; an OAuth2 implementation with PKCE using the Spring Authorization Server and OAuth2 Client to secure the authorization code flow; and an OAuth2 Authorization Server with a BCryptPasswordEncoder for secure password storage. Additionally, it covers Custom UserDetails from a database, Customizing ID_Token and Access_Token for tailored token information, and Role-Based Access Control, where roles are extracted from JWT and mapped to GrantedAuthorities. Lastly, it includes an OAuth2 Client with Role-Based Access Control, integrating roles from JWT into Spring Security for granular authorization.
